# rm-locationAPI-HS
Simple script fix to get Hearthstone working on Linux

# Usage
Simply paste your install path to:
```
.../Program Files (x86)/Hearthstone/Hearthstone_Data/Plugins/x86/LocationAPI.dll
```
into

>filepath.txt

# Why?
Game crashes when file is present and constantly redownloads it upon relaunch. This script checks if battlenet is open, and deletes the file if present, fixing the issue.
